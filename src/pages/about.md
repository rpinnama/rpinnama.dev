I'm an experienced software engineer with over 14 years of hands-on development and architecture experience across aviation, UAVs, robotics, geospatial mapping, Web3, and AI. Most recently, I've led engineering teams, managed cross-functional projects, and owned architectural decisions from concept to deployment. I'm passionate about building impactful systems at the intersection of robotics, autonomous flight, AI, and decentralized technologies.

This site serves as both a technical blog where I share my thoughts on emerging technologies and a portfolio showcasing the projects I've worked on throughout my career. Whether you're interested in generative AI innovations, AI applications in robotics, the latest UAV developments, or evolving trends in software engineering and architecture, you'll find something here that resonates with your interests.

Feel free to explore my blog posts and project portfolio, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss any of the topics I cover here.
